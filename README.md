Yet another map editorâ€”this time, I swear it will be good!
This is a more advanced and better designed map editor for a build-style engine
I *need* to refactor my code

## Goals
- [x] Vertex Editing
- [x] Move sectors
- [x] Wall Editing
- [ ] Texture Changing
- [ ] Floor and Ceiling Changes
- [ ] 'Portals' between sectors (Doorways etc.)
- [ ] Wall Decals
- [ ] Object spawns
- [ ] Player spawns
- [ ] Entity spawns
- [ ] Texture Manager
- [ ] Saving and Loading files

## Requirements

I use vcpkg for getting these dependencies

- `imgui-sfml`
- `sfml`
- `imgui`
