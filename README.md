# Christapheno
Yet another map editorâ€”this time, I swear it will be good!
This is a more advanced and better designed map editor for a build-style engine
I *need* to refactor my code

# Video Demos
Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/TGkW_AIIZzI) demo of the level/map editor


## Goals
- [x] Vertex Editing
- [x] Move sectors
- [x] Wall Editing
- [ ] Texture Changing
- [x] Floor and Ceiling Changes
- [ ] 'Portals' between sectors (Doorways etc.)
- [ ] Wall Decals
- [ ] Object spawns
- [ ] Player spawns
- [ ] Entity spawns
- [ ] Texture Manager
- [ ] Saving and Loading files
- [ ] Key binds

I hope to be able to make a small FPS game when I have fully finished the editor and renderer, just to see how much I can do with this sort of project.

## Requirements

I use vcpkg for getting these dependencies

- `imgui-sfml`
- `sfml`
- `imgui`
- `thor`
- `nativefiledialogue`
